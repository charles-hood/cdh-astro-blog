Hey there! 👋 I'm a tech enthusiast in my 50s, living in either "Atlanta" or Canton, GA — depending on who's asking. My passions include tech, live music, and exploring new places through travel.

## Tech Treks 💻
As a tech enthusiast, I love diving into the latest gadgets, coding projects, and exploring the ever-evolving tech landscape. From tinkering with new software to embracing the latest tech trends, I'm always game for whatever comes next.

## Live Music 🎵
**Small venues, big passion.** There's something truly magical about experiencing music in a space where the energy is palpable and the connection between artists and audience is undeniable. That's where I thrive.

**Supporting local artists is a priority for me.** I'm convinced that some of the most talented musicians are right here in our communities, and I'm committed to championing their voices. While I'm down for all kinds of musical genres, there's something about Americana and singer/songwriter vibes that just speak to my soul. It's like they have a backstage pass to my feels.

## Nomadic Quests 🛩️
Travel is another passion of mine. Exploring new places, meeting interesting people, and immersing myself in the beauty of different landscapes—these adventures fuel my curiosity.

## About This Website 🌐
Everyone needs a personal space on the web apart from the big social media platforms, and this is mine. This website is hosted for free using a combination of [Github](https://github.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It's built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) with the beautiful [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme, making it lightning fast and SEO-friendly. The content is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), which makes it easy to manage. In other words, I took advantage of several awesome free tools and technologies to assemble this website for no cost, with minimal coding—just some light customization to make it my own. If you'd like to try the same thing, let me know and I can help you get started.

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to connect on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/charleshood) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charleshood/). Let's share our love for tech, tunes, and travel!
